Adding provider to the index.js file in a React project
makes sure that the store will be available app-wide.

Using "createSlice" API from Redux Toolkit allows us
to create individual slice reducers, each of them
in control of its state.

Creating a slice requires a string name, an initial state
value, and one or more reducer functions to decide how
the state will change.

Below code is technically a mutation expression, but the
Immer library converts mutating expressions to 
non-mutating ones, like the example below:
    state.value += 1

Immer detects changes to a draft state and produces
a brand new immutable state based on those changes.

The "useSelector" API is used to read data from the store.
The "useDispatch" API is used to dispatch action objects.
Both are available in components that are wrapped by
the provider.
