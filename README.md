My notes on Redux.

This repo records all the notes, example scripts and links that I think is helpful to learn Flux pattern.

The main library: **Redux** 

Other supporting libraries that help to deal with Redux side effects:
- Redux-Thunk
- Redux-Promise
- Redux-Pack
- Redux-Saga
- Redux-Observable
- Redux-Logic
- Redux-Loop
