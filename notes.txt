React Redux needs React Hooks from newer React versions
- React 16.8.3 or later
- React Native 0.59 or later

Overall it has 2 major APIs:
- Provider (Gives redux store access to the entire app)
- Hooks (Custom React hooks especially for the redux store)

useSelector reads a value from the store state and subscribes to 
updates.
useDispatch returns the store's dispatch method for state changes.

Redux is a standalone library that works with any UI layer and 
frameworks.
- React
- Angular
- Vue
- Ember
- Vanilla JS

Commonly UI binding libraries bridge the gap between React and Redux

Why use Redux?
- States are increasingly complex.
- Logical states include server responses, cached data and 
locally calculated data.
- UI states include routes, selected tabs, spinners, pagination
controls and more.
- When scope grows, developer slowly loses the capability to
mentally track how different states interact with each other.
- Debugging becomes difficult as states are non-deterministic.

Three principles of Redux:
- Single source of truth.
    - The global state is stored in an object tree within a single 
    store.

- State is read-only.
    - The only way to change the state is to emit an action that 
    describes what to do. The action is an object.

- Changes are made with pure functions.
    - To specify how state tree is transformed, we use pure
    reducers.

When to use Redux?
- Application states are too numerous.
- State is updated very frequently.
- State update logic is complex.
- Codebase is medium or large-sized with multiple contributors.
- Need to see how state is being updated over time.

Redux uses React Context API.

By wrapping all the components with Redux provider, it (accidentally)
solves the unnecessary prop-drills when many components need to
use a single state.

Redux allows developer to produce applications that

- Persist state to a local storage and then boot up 
from it, out of the box.

- Pre-fill state on the server, send it to the client in HTML, 
and boot up from it, out of the box.

- Serialize user actions and attach them, together with a state 
snapshot, to automated bug reports, so that the product developers 
can replay them to reproduce the errors.

- Pass action objects over the network to implement collaborative 
environments without dramatic changes to how the code is written.

- Maintain an undo history or implement optimistic mutations without 
dramatic changes to how the code is written.

- Travel between the state history in development, and re-evaluate 
the current state from the action history when the code changes, 
a la TDD.

- Provide full inspection and control capabilities to the development 
tooling so that product developers can build custom tools for their 
apps.

- Provide alternative UIs while reusing most of the business logic.

What is a reducer?
- A function that takes a current state value and an action object
describing "what happened" and returns a new state value.

The signature of a reducer is:
(state, action) => newState
 
When changing Redux state, should not mutate the state object,
but return a new object if the state changes.
	
Reducer decides how every action transforms the application state.

1 Redux store has 1 reducer, but as the project grows, the root
reducer can be separated into multiple smaller reducers.

Redux is really:
- A single store containing "global" state.
- Dispatching plain object actions to the store when
something happens in the app
- Pure reducer functions looking at those actions and
returning immutably updated state

There are other things accompanying Redux projects:
- Action creators that generate object actions.
- Middleware to enable side-effects.
- Thunk functions that contain sync or async logic
with side effects.
- Normalized state to enable looking up items by ID.
- Memoized selector functions with the Reselect library
for optimizing derived data.
- The Redux DevTools Extension to view your action
history and state changes.
- TypeScript types for actions, state, and other functions.

Redux core provides below APIs:
- "createStore" to create a Redux store
- "combineReducers" to combine multiple slice reducers
into a single larger reducer
- "applyMiddleware" to combine multiple middleware into
a store enhancer
- "compose" to combine multiple store enhancers into a
single store enhancer.
